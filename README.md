# Aesthetic Sticky Notes

**Your new tab, reimagined.** A calm, focused space to capture notes—with AI help and nature backgrounds.

---

## Why this?

Open a new tab and land in a clean sticky-notes page instead of a blank screen or a feed. Write, tag, and organize from one place. Optional AI helps you expand or refine text. Gentle nature backgrounds and themes keep it easy on the eyes.

- **Notes that stick** — Create as many notes as you need. Pin, tag, color, and search. Everything saves automatically.
- **AI when you want it** — Select text and ask AI to expand, shorten, or rephrase. One click, no app switching.
- **Calm by default** — Daily nature backgrounds, dark and glass themes, optional weather. Your tab stays useful, not noisy.
- **Yours only** — Notes and settings live in your browser. No account required to use it.
